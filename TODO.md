# TODO

Paused 2026-10-06. State: GLM-5.3-Flash (ds4 IQ2 file) on B70 + B65, served as the box's chat mode `glm53`, MTP on
by default (`--no-mtp` turns it off).

## Done

- [x] Server (`nextsycl serve`): OpenAI API, streaming, thinking split out, prompt-prefix reuse, graceful stop (7931d08)
- [x] Wired into the box: studio llm mode `glm53` + model-switch entry (LIGHT: no tools, no background tasks)
- [x] MTP speculative decoding (8faf2e9): draft block over the whole conversation, 2-row verify, KDA snapshot
      rollback, exact acceptance. Greedy 13.1 -> 15.7 tok/s, 87% of drafts accepted on a code prompt; verify rows
      bit-identical to one-token decode (`nextsycl spec-check`: 0 difference over 94 rows)

## Long context (done 2026-10-06)

- [x] The DSA lightning indexer (llama.cpp de25343 `build_kpool_select` / `set_input_kpool`): pools of 4, a pool
      visible once complete, top 512 pools per row plus the row's incomplete pool, dense below 512 pools
- [x] Pooled keys in the pass that completes them (a 4-token ring of ik | ig per layer); scores as GEMMs; a radix
      top-k with a scan compaction (deterministic); attention scores in local memory (<= 2,051 cells a row)
- [x] The MTP block through its own indexer
- [x] VRAM held for the sessions' attention caches before the expert store sizes itself
- [x] Parity: 3,180-token prompt against llama.cpp - layer 3's attention output 0.99999 with selection active, the
      same next token; deeper layers drift smoothly (0.98 by layer 23, no layer jumps); spec-check 0 difference
- [x] 12,202-token prompt runs (prompt 60 tok/s, decode 12.1 tok/s - flat with context); the chat mode serves 64K
- [ ] 128K: the latents are float32 (2 KB a token a layer; 6.5 GB for two 128K sessions) - fp16 latents first
- [ ] Prompt speed (2026-10-06): 271 tok/s at 3K, 287 at 12K (from 23 at the start of the long-context work; 4,096
      chunks, experts and dense matrices in fp16 on XMX, the IQ2_XXS expander fixed). At 12K, of 42 s: routed
      experts 18.7 s (fp16 gate/up GEMM 5.0, its expansion 3.8, down 1.8 - the rest the PCIe reads of host experts),
      KDA scan 7.7 s, MLA attention 6.7 s, hc pre 4.2 s. Next: a fused dequant + XMX GEMM (no fp16 copy of each
      expert), the KDA scan chunked (WY / chunked delta rule), MLA attention as XMX tiles
- [ ] Decode past 2K: 12.1 vs 15.7 tok/s short - the indexer's per-token GEMM + the attention kernel

## Prompt speed: what Strata's prompt path teaches (its numbers on the B70, docs/INTEL.md there)

- [ ] **Bigger chunks.** Strata reads prompts in 4,096-token chunks; at 2,048 an 80K prompt took 278 s, at 4,096 77 s
      (its experts not in VRAM are streamed once per chunk). Here a 512-token chunk routes ~14 tokens to an expert;
      at 4,096 it would be ~114, so every expert's weights (from VRAM or over PCIe) serve 8x the tokens, and the
      expanded fp16 GEMM path (measured slower at 512: 22.6 tok/s) becomes a real GEMM. What stops it: the arena
      (~1.5 MB of temporaries a token: 6 GB at 4,096). Trim the per-token temporaries (fp16 activations, in-place
      KDA/MoE buffers), and borrow VRAM for the rest.
- [ ] **Borrow expert slots for the prompt** (Strata's "prompt path borrows N cache slots"): during a long prompt,
      lend part of the VRAM expert cache to the chunk's temporaries / a streaming ring, give it back for decode.
      Strata mirrors the lent slots in pinned host memory so the refill after the prompt is a RAM copy (its "lend
      mirror": prompt +15-40%, refill 720-2,240 -> 200-380 ms).
- [ ] **A stager: stream the next layer's experts while this one computes** (Strata's 96-slot streamed ring, a copy
      queue, a polled sequence flag - never host waits on queue events: they deadlocked under Level Zero v2). Today
      the in-place PCIe reads sit on the compute critical path.
- [ ] **Group by expert across the chunk, one launch a layer** - done (the grouped kernels); prompt lanes 32 a row.
- [ ] **QSA / indexer scores as GEMM tiles** (Strata's QSA block scores: a GEMM tile per block pair) - the indexer
      here already scores by GEMM; the MLA prompt attention (12 s of 47 at 3K) is the per-row kernel: tile it.
- [ ] **Dequant with vector stores** (Strata: 575 -> 841 tok/s at 2K / 8K) for any path that still expands weights.

## Speed, later

- [x] Prompt chunks read host-slot experts in place over PCIe (no swaps); decode still swaps (faster there: 12.5 vs
      11.2 tok/s with NS_DECODE_DIRECT=1)
- [ ] Expert swaps at decode: 32 ms/token with MTP (2-row passes touch more experts). Strata's answer (its 2.6 -> 40.9 tok/s on
      the B70): the GPU reads missed experts straight from pinned host memory in the expert kernel (the grouped
      kernel already takes a pointer per expert - pass the host slot's address), a share of the misses (pcie_frac
      ~0.55) and LRU admission for the rest. Pinned memory belongs to the context that allocated it: each part reads
      only its own mirror (Strata #1054 hung two B70s on a cross-context fill)
- [ ] Deeper drafts (chain the MTP block; MAX_VERIFY > 2)
- [ ] Launch overhead: SYCL graph replay for the decode step
- [ ] Prefill speed

## Later

- [ ] qwen4exp (the Coder family) and a `--model` switch between runtimes (Strata does 75 tok/s on it today)
- [ ] IQ3 variants of GLM (NOTES.md)
