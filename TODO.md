# TODO

Paused 2026-10-06. State: GLM-5.3-Flash (ds4 IQ2 file) on B70 + B65, served as the box's chat mode `glm53`, MTP on
by default (`--no-mtp` turns it off).

## Done

- [x] Server (`nextsycl serve`): OpenAI API, streaming, thinking split out, prompt-prefix reuse, graceful stop (7931d08)
- [x] Wired into the box: studio llm mode `glm53` + model-switch entry (LIGHT: no tools, no background tasks)
- [x] MTP speculative decoding (8faf2e9): draft block over the whole conversation, 2-row verify, KDA snapshot
      rollback, exact acceptance. Greedy 13.1 -> 15.7 tok/s, 87% of drafts accepted on a code prompt; verify rows
      bit-identical to one-token decode (`nextsycl spec-check`: 0 difference over 94 rows)

## Long context (done 2026-10-06)

- [x] The DSA lightning indexer (llama.cpp de25343 `build_kpool_select` / `set_input_kpool`): pools of 4, a pool
      visible once complete, top 512 pools per row plus the row's incomplete pool, dense below 512 pools
- [x] Pooled keys in the pass that completes them (a 4-token ring of ik | ig per layer); scores as GEMMs; a radix
      top-k with a scan compaction (deterministic); attention scores in local memory (<= 2,051 cells a row)
- [x] The MTP block through its own indexer
- [x] VRAM held for the sessions' attention caches before the expert store sizes itself
- [x] Parity: 3,180-token prompt against llama.cpp - layer 3's attention output 0.99999 with selection active, the
      same next token; deeper layers drift smoothly (0.98 by layer 23, no layer jumps); spec-check 0 difference
- [x] 12,202-token prompt runs (prompt 60 tok/s, decode 12.1 tok/s - flat with context); the chat mode serves 64K
- [ ] 128K: the latents are float32 (2 KB a token a layer; 6.5 GB for two 128K sessions) - fp16 latents first
- [ ] Prompt speed: 67 tok/s at 3K (a 32K prompt ~9 min). Left: MLA prompt attention (12 s of 47), KDA (8 s), the
      grouped expert kernels themselves (28 s; a tiled int8 / XMX prompt kernel is the next lever)
- [ ] Decode past 2K: 12.1 vs 15.7 tok/s short - the indexer's per-token GEMM + the attention kernel

## Speed, later

- [x] Prompt chunks read host-slot experts in place over PCIe (no swaps); decode still swaps (faster there: 12.5 vs
      11.2 tok/s with NS_DECODE_DIRECT=1)
- [ ] Expert swaps at decode: 32 ms/token with MTP (2-row passes touch more experts). Strata's answer (its 2.6 -> 40.9 tok/s on
      the B70): the GPU reads missed experts straight from pinned host memory in the expert kernel (the grouped
      kernel already takes a pointer per expert - pass the host slot's address), a share of the misses (pcie_frac
      ~0.55) and LRU admission for the rest. Pinned memory belongs to the context that allocated it: each part reads
      only its own mirror (Strata #1054 hung two B70s on a cross-context fill)
- [ ] Deeper drafts (chain the MTP block; MAX_VERIFY > 2)
- [ ] Launch overhead: SYCL graph replay for the decode step
- [ ] Prefill speed

## Later

- [ ] qwen4exp (the Coder family) and a `--model` switch between runtimes (Strata does 75 tok/s on it today)
- [ ] IQ3 variants of GLM (NOTES.md)
